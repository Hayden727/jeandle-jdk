// Jeandle includes many LLVM header files, and produces some macro conflicts with Hotspot header files.
// The current conflicts are:
//   1. AARCH64
//   2. assert
// We use __llvmHeadersBegin__.hpp and __HotspotHeadersBegin__.hpp to solve them.

// All Jeandle source files should include __llvmHeadersBegin__.hpp and __hotspotHeadersBegin__.hpp
// like this:
//   #include "jeandle/__llvmHeadersBegin__.hpp"
//   #include "llvm/..."
//   #include "llvm/..."
//
//   #include "jeandle/..."
//   #include "jeandle/..."
//
//   #include "jeandle/__hostpotHeadersBegin__.hpp"
//   // Here we can include header files from Hotspot.

// __llvmHeadersBegin__.hpp is used to define 'assert' from stdlib for LLVM, because Hotspot uses a self defined 'assert'
// and it's not compatible with stdlib's 'assert'. This header file also undefines 'AARCH64' which is defined by Hotspot
// and conflicts with LLVM's 'AArch64'.

#include <cassert>
#ifdef AARCH64
  #define SAVED_HOTSPOT_AARCH64
  #undef AARCH64
#endif // AARCH64
